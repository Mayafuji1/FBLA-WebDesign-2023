        <h4 class="about"> About Bean & Bean </h4>
        <p> Bean & Bean is an animal cafe with a variety of personalities you can hang out with while you have a light snack!
            We partner with local animal shelters to make this possible. As a bonus, if you find your new perfect pet while hanging out at the cafe, you 
            can apply to adopt and bring them into a new home! All purchases made will be spent to benefit our pets!
            <br>
            The name "Bean & Bean" originates from the idea of coffee beans and the pop. culture term "bean" used to describe the paw pads of animals!

            <h4> Our Mission </h4>
                <p>B&B is focused on finding new homes for our animals by giving them new opportunities to socialize and get to know patrons that are looking to adopt. 
                Every purchase made at the café goes toward supporting all the animals we take in.

        <h4 class="about"> About the Founders </h4>
        <p >Established in 2020, B&B was founded by Paul and Michelle McIntosh. They met at the local animal shelter, which Paul owned, when Michelle, 
            a recent graduate of the Gatton College of Business at UK, was looking for a furry friend to accompany her during the lonely days of quarantine. 
            Michelle saw how much the shelter was struggling to stay afloat during the pandemic, so she proposed the idea of an animal café to Paul.
